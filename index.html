                <h1>How My Perspective on Money Changed as I Grew Up</h1>
                <p class="date">May 10th, 2020</p>
                <p>When I was a kid, I wanted to become a scientist. A.P.J Abdul Kalam, Aravind Gupta were my role models. Dr Abdul Kalam is the embodiment of every Indian ideal. Aravind Gupta is an Indian toymaker and expert in science who created several low-cost science teaching aids by turning trash into toys for learning. Both of them spent a considerable amount of their lives teaching kids. These were the dream teachers we all yearned for.</p>
                <p>I wanted to create things/models to make science interesting for kids, just like them. After reading Vivekananda’s opinion on education, Knowledge is so sacred that no man ought to sell it, I wanted to do it for free. By free, I mean accepting what they could offer rather than demanding a certain fixed lump sum from everyone.</p>
                <p>To sum it all up, I wanted to become a scientist-teacher like Aamir Khan in the 3 idiots ending (my favourite Hindi movie!).</p>
                <p>Then life added a new variable to my pursuit — money. Before this, like most of the Indian kids, I had no idea about the importance of it. It took me a lot of time to include this variable in my understanding of the world as people around me rarely talked about it. I realised how hard people are trying to earn it, and I hated it for the social inequality it created.</p>
                <p>From the Economic point of view, Engineering seemed like a better way to pursue science. Even this one seemed like a cool thing to do. When I thought this, I was thinking about Iron Man — Robotics, money and attitude. Although after getting into it, I realised the amount of hard work it takes to reach that stage. Now I am talking about Elon Musk (This guy is the real-world Iron Man!). If you had asked me what I want to become back then, I would have shouted back “Mechanical Engineer!” without any second thoughts.</p>
                <p>Somewhere back then I read a book named Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. He introduced me to the world of compound interests, passive income and investing. It is all about Financial Freedom. After reading that I realised, I don’t need to work 9–5 every day throughout my life. It showed me that I could earn, even when I am sleeping. But still, deep down, I hated money for creating the social disparity.</p>
                <p>I came across Naval Ravikant for the first time through a podcast (kind of like online radio) named The Knowledge Project. This guy introduced me to the whole new concept of wealth. He explains why we should focus on wealth instead of money.</p>
                <p class="quote">
                    “Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.”
                    — Naval Ravikant
                </p>
                <p>He explains that earning money (or status) is a zero-sum game. It means that we just exchange money; we generally don’t create it in our everyday lives. For someone to gain it, someone has to lose it, so the net effect is zero. Most of us trade our time/knowledge to get money so that we can buy whatever we want. The problem with this is that we won’t have a lot of freedom in doing this. Someone superior to us will dictate your actions, and we have to follow them to earn money.</p>
                <p> For example office hours, dress code is dictated by someone who is above you in the chain of hierarchy. But if you own a business, you will earn a lot more money (leverage) and also have the freedom of choice. So by creating new stuff, i.e. adding value to society or by owning a part of a company which does so, we generate money. This is a positive-sum game.</p>
                <p>After I understood this, I stopped seeing money as the end goal and started to view it as a token of appreciation that society pays us for adding value to it. Wealth is just creating cash in a better way (positive-sum game) without sacrificing our freedom.</p>
